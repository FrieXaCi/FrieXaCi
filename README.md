- 👋 Hi, I’m Frieda @FrieXaCi, I live in the Netherlands
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, cos i like to be in control i decided to learn fullstack.
      What i have learned most for now is to never give up and to have faith in yourself. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and react

- 💞️ I’m looking for project witch i can do with the skills i already have like html, css and sass.

- 📫 You can reach me by mail, tell me you found me via Github at fharingsma@hotmail.com
